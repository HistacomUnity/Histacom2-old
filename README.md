# Histacom 2
## The remake of the original hacking simulator!
Histacom 2 is a C# version of the PC game Histacom, released by 12padams in 2010. Here are some of our goals:
* Get Histacom 2 to the same playable state that the original Histacom's in and beyond.
* Add more applications to the operating systems.
* Add more story elements.

## Building
Histacom 2 is currently being developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. Visual Studio 2015 has also been proven to work. If you are using a different IDE, please do so with caution. We cannot guarantee the stability of other IDEs.

Load the ``.sln`` project file into Visual Studio and compile. No further steps are required. This list may grow in the future.
